# H1-B-Analysis-for-2019-2022


<h2 align="left"> The problem </h2>
As international students and non US-citzens we need to understand the options we have to be able to start a career in the US. H1-B Lotery is one of these doors. However, just because it a lotery doesn't mean we should close our eyes. We can analyze the data and improve our odds of getting an approval.

What is the H1-B Visa?

"U.S. businesses use the H-1B visa program to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require the theoretical or practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge, including but not limited to: scientists, engineers, or computer programmers." (USCIS, 2022). 

<h2 align="left"> Our Goal! </h2>
The goal of this project is to provide a report that examines the most attractive (in terms of approval rate and average salary) jobs for international analytics master's students who wish to work in the US and must submit an H1-B visa application.
